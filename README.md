## Description
An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.[1] For example, the word anagram itself can be rearranged into nag a ram, also the word binary into brainy and the word adobe into abode.

The original word or phrase is known as the subject of the anagram. Any word or phrase that exactly reproduces the letters in another order is an anagram. Someone who creates anagrams may be called an "anagrammatist",[2] and the goal of a serious or skilled anagrammatist is to produce anagrams that reflect or comment on their subject.

## Examples
Anagrams may be created as a commentary on the subject. They may be a parody, a criticism or satire. For example:

>- "New York Times" = "monkeys write"
>- "Church of Scientology" = "rich-chosen goofy cult"
>- "McDonald's restaurants" = "Uncle Sam's standard rot"
>- "coronavirus" = "carnivorous"
>- "She Sells Sanctuary" = "Santa; shy, less cruel" or "Satan; cruel, less shy"
